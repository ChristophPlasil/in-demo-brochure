====================
Use of inland ECDIS
====================

Inland AIS is only useful on board a ship when information of other ships is visible on an Inland ECDIS chart. Therefore it is strongly recommended to combine Inland AIS with Inland ECDIS. This allows AIS information of other ships and from shore to be displayed on the Inland Electronic Navigational Chart (IENC).

The user can decide which chart information (all info, standard, or minimum) is visible on the screen via the settings of the Inland ECDIS. By zooming-in or zooming-out, some information will appear or disappear.

With respect to AIS information, AIS positions of other ships are always displayed. The user can decide for additional AIS information (label) of all ships or only one ship by pointing to the ship with the mouse. In case too many AIS symbols are visible on the screen, the user may zoom-in to decrease the viewing area and reduce the AIS information.

Some Inland ECDIS can support Inland AIS for the input of voyage-related AIS information such as navigational status, destination, number of persons on board, etc.
