General introduction
====================
These Guidelines have been developed to promote the safe and effective use of shipborne Inland Automatic Identification Systems (Inland AIS), and in particular to inform skippers about their operation, limitations and potential uses.

Consequently, Inland AIS should be operated taking into account these Guidelines.
These Guidelines will help skippers become familiar with the operational use of Inland AIS on inland waterways, including the correct interpretation of the displayed data.
