msgid "Some ships have the blue sign connected to the Inland AIS station; others do not have this connection. Skippers should be aware of this situation. Not all AIS symbols on the ECDIS will represent the real situation with respect to the connection of the blue sign. So, if the blue sign is not shown, it will not necessarily indicate that the blue sign is not set, because of the possible missing connection!"
