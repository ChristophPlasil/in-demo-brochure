msgid "AIS is an identification system providing information about identification of the ship and its position. No detailed information of the cargo onboard is transmitted. In general it can be said that mainly information which can be seen on the ship itself is sent in AIS messages."

msgid "(Inland) AIS is an open broadcasting system. This means that AIS is sending out messages which everyone with AIS equipment can receive and read. The reason that AIS is an open system is because AIS is designed for safety purposes so that everyone can receive the messages."

msgid "Competent Authorities are obligated to respect privacy regulations. Reception of AIS information can easily be achieved with AIS receiving stations. However, publication of AIS information on the internet without permission of the sender (owner) of the information is not allowed in most European countries. In some countries even the reception of AIS information by uninvolved parties is forbidden."
