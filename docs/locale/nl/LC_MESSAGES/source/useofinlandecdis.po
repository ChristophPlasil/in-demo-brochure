"Inland AIS is only useful on board a ship when information of other ships"
" is visible on an Inland ECDIS chart. Therefore it is strongly "
"recommended to combine Inland AIS with Inland ECDIS. This allows AIS "
"information of other ships and from shore to be displayed on the Inland "
"Electronic Navigational Chart (IENC)."

"The user can decide which chart information (all info, standard, or "
"minimum) is visible on the screen via the settings of the Inland ECDIS. "
"By zooming-in or zooming-out, some information will appear or disappear."

"With respect to AIS information, AIS positions of other ships are always "
"displayed. The user can decide for additional AIS information (label) of "
"all ships or only one ship by pointing to the ship with the mouse. In "
"case too many AIS symbols are visible on the screen, the user may zoom-in"
" to decrease the viewing area and reduce the AIS information."
