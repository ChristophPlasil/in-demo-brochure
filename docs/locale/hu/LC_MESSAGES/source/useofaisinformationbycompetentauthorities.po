"Waterway authorities are gaining experience with this rather new "
"technology for inland waterways. The collected information sent by the "
"Inland AIS stations is mainly used for monitoring purposes. This "
"information gives the authorities an overview of the situation on the "
"waterways, ships heading towards their locks and bridges, and ships "
"leaving their network."

"In the near future, Inland AIS networks will be used by some authorities "
"to communicate important information (e.g. water levels) and information "
"about dangerous situations (e.g. calamity information) directly and "
"efficiently via AIS to the skippers. This information will be visible on "
"the installed Inland ECDIS. More efficient lock/bridge planning is also "
"possible, allowing smooth traffic with minimal delays at locks and "
"bridges."
