"Inland AIS is based on the Maritime AIS. AIS uses radio technology. "
"Through radio signals AIS stations, sometimes called AIS transponders, "
"send out messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatisais.rst:6
msgid ""
"These messages can be received by all other AIS stations, on ships and "
"onshore, in the vicinity of the sending station within VHF radio range. "
"This happens automatically and periodically, with shorter or longer "
"intervals. A fast-moving ship will send out AIS messages at shorter "
"intervals than a ship that is travelling slower or is moored. Two special"
" VHF radio channels are reserved to exchange AIS messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatisais.rst:8
msgid ""
"Certain hardware and software is needed for AIS. The hardware is an AIS "
"station with built-in GPS. For a user-friendly presentation of the "
"content of AIS messages, additional equipment (e.g. Inland ECDIS, see "
"chapter 3) is needed."

msgid ""
"The information in these messages includes the identity of the ship, the "
"position, and other ship-related information (see chapter 2 for details)."
" Some of the information, such as ship identity and position, is "
"automatically broadcast. Other information, such as navigation status, "
"destination, and dangerous cargo category (blue cones), can be input "
"manually by the skipper. All data that is input manually has to be "
"accurate and valid."

"The following points should be considered when using information conveyed"
" by AIS :"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatisais.rst:16
msgid ""
"Always bear in mind that other ships may not be equipped with AIS; an AIS"
" station installed on another ship might transmit incomplete, erroneous "
"or not updated information; AIS may fail; or AIS might be switched off."

"Not all shore infrastructures are equipped with AIS base stations, e.g. "
"locks and Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) centres."

"Users should ensure that they are able to correctly interpret the data "
"received."

"AIS is purely an additional source of information. It does not replace "
"navigational aids such as radar, but is intended to support them."
