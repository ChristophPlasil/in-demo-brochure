"The **Dynamic information** is all information referring to the movements"
" of a ship, such as position, speed, course and navigational status. "
"Dynamic information is automatically derived from on-board sensors, and "
"includes GPS, heading, and rate of turn indicators if available. Only the"
" navigational status should be input manually via the Minimum Keyboard "
"and Display (MKD) or via a connected, approved input device supporting "
"the MKD functionality."

"**Voyage-related information** is information relating to the voyage of a"
" ship. This includes destinationÂ¹ , present draught and hazardous cargo "
"classification (blue cones). For a ship sailing in a convoy, the "
"following information is also required: the length and beam of the convoy"
" (see Annex 2), the position of the GPS antenna, and the ERI ship or "
"convoy type. All voyage-related information should be input manually on "
"the MKD or via a connected, approved input device (e.g. Inland ECDIS "
"supporting the MKD functionality). The proper input is the responsibility"
" of the captain of the ship."

"To summarise: all data transmitted should be correct, including data "
