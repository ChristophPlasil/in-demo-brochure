"As mentioned above, there are several types of AIS stations. For mobile "
"(on board) use, Class A, Class B and Inland AIS stations can be "
"distinguished."

"Commercial inland shipping should carry Inland AIS, taking national "
"regulations into account with respect to mandatory carriage requirements."
" Non-propelled ships which normally sail in convoy with a tow or push "
"ship do not require their own Inland AIS station on board. AIS "
"information of a convoy will be sent by the tow or push ship taking the "
"new dimensions of the convoy into account. In a tow convoy with two or "
"more propelled ships, each of the ships should send its own information, "
"including its own dimensions and with the appropriate ERI ship and convoy"
" type."

"Maritime ships carry (mandatory) Class A stations. Inland AIS stations "
"are almost equal to Class A stations. The difference is that Inland AIS "
"has some inland-specific additional information such as ENI number, blue "
"sign,  blue cones, etc. Inland ships can see all AIS information from "
"maritime ships. Maritime ships can see all ‘standard’ AIS information of "
"all inland ships but the specific inland information will not be "
"presented. In sea port areas and sea river areas, mixed traffic with both"
" Class A and Inland AIS stations can be expected."

"For recreational ships, Class B stations are allowed in all areas. They "
"do not have the full functionality of Class A or Inland AIS stations but "
"the most relevant messages like position and identity will be received by"
" all Class A and Inland AIS stations and vice versa. Class B stations are"
" not allowed on commercial maritime ships and on commercial inland ships "
"as described in this chapter. When AIS symbols are displayed on (Inland) "
"ECDIS or radar, the difference between the described types of mobile AIS "
"stations is not always visible (same symbol)."
